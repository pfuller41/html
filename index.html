     <h1>Introduction to Programming</h1>
      <h2>Components of the Web</h2>
        <p>The major pieces are you, your computer running a <strong> web browser, the Internet, and servers.</strong></p>
        <p>Your browser makes requests via the Internet to <strong> servers.</strong> These requests are using a <strong> protocol called HTTP.</strong></p>
        <p>And the <strong>servers respond</strong> with files that the <strong>browser displays.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Servers are computers</strong> just like yours except they are <strong>optimized</strong> for sitting in a closet and
        <strong>hosting files</strong></p>
        <p>The <strong>protocol HTTP</strong> is just a very simple protocol that your <strong>browser uses to communicate with these servers.</strong></p>

      <b>HTML</b>
        <p><b>HTML</b><em>(Hypertext Markup Language)</em> documents form the majority of content on the web.
        <b>HTML</b> contains <strong><em>text content</em></strong> "what you see" and <strong><em>markup</em></strong> "how it looks."</p>

      <b>Tags and Elements</b>
          <p><b>HTML</b> elements are what we use to tell a web browser how to display content on a web page.</p>
          <p>Most <b>HTML</b> elements consist of an <em>opening</em> and a <em>closing</em> tag with some content between them.</p>
          <p>Some elements accept additional values called <b>attributes</b> in their opening tags.</p>
          <p><b>Attributes</b> provide additional information to the browser. For example, the <b>anchor tag</b> takes an attribute called <b>href</b> that defines a <b>URL</b> to link to.</p>

      <b>It's Okay to Forget</b>
          <p>New programmers often struggle with this because in other learning environments it's often important that you remember a lot of facts.</p>
          <p>But programming doesn't work like that!  There's just too many facts to remember them all.</p>
          <p>Instead, you need to understand a few big ideas and know how to get the details you need when you need them</p></div>
          <p>When you do forget stuff, there's lots of resources to help you out:</p>

      <b>Inline vs. Block Elements</b>
        <p>In this video, Steve explains the distinction between inline and block elements.</p>

      <b>Span and Div Elements</b>
        <p>Span is an <em>inline</em> element.</p>
        <p>Div is a <em>block</em> element.</p>

      <b>HTML Document Structure</b>
        <p>A part of writing good code is structuring it well.</p>
        <p>In <b>HTML</b> particularly, the indentation level increases when an idea begins and decreases when an idea is finished.</p>
        <p>The first line  should appear on every webpage you make. <b>DOCTYPE html</b> defines the type of the document so.</p>
        <p>The <b>html</b> tag opens, our document. Everything that shows on the webpage is placed within this tag.</p>
        <p>The <b>head</b> tag defines metadata for our web page. This includes the title of the page (this is what appears in the top of your tab or browser window).</p>
        <p>The <b>title</b> tag is closed on the same line it was opened which we usually do if the content of a tag is short.
        The <b>head</b> tag is closed on a different line.</p>
        <p>Notice that inside the <b>body</b> tags you have the content of the web page.</p> 
        <p>You can see an <b>h</b> tag that is indented just inside the body as well as a <b>p</b> tag that is on the same level of indentation as the <b>h.</b></p>
