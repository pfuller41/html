     <h1>Introduction to Programming</h1>
      <h2>Components of the Web</h2>
        <p>The major pieces are you, your computer running a <strong> web browser, the Internet, and servers.</strong>
        Your browser makes requests via the Internet to <strong> servers.</strong><br> These requests are using a <strong> protocol called HTTP.</strong>
        And the <strong>servers respond</strong> with files that the <strong>browser displays.</strong><br>
        <strong>Servers are computers</strong> just like yours except they are <strong>optimized</strong> for sitting in a closet and <strong>hosting files</strong>
        <br>The <strong>protocol HTTP</strong> is just a very simple protocol that your <strong>browser uses to communicate with these servers.</strong></br></p>

      <h2>HTML</h2>
        <p><b>HTML</b><em>(Hypertext Markup Language)</em> documents form the majority of content on the web.<br>
        <b>HTML</b> contains <strong><em>text content</em></strong> "what you see" and <strong><em>markup</em></strong> "how it looks."</br></p>

      <h2>Tags and Elements</h2>
          <p><b>HTML</b> elements are what we use to tell a web browser how to display content on a web page.
          <br>Most <b>HTML</b> elements consist of an <em>opening</em> and a <em>closing</em> tag with some content between them.
          <br>Some elements accept additional values called <b>attributes</b> in their opening tags.
          <br><b>Attributes</b> provide additional information to the browser. For example, the <b>anchor tag</b> takes an attribute called <b>href</b> that defines a <b>URL</b> to link to.</br></p>
          <ul>

      <h2>It's Okay to Forget</h2>
          <p>New programmers often struggle with this because in other learning environments it's often important that you remember a lot of facts.
          <br>But programming doesn't work like that!  There's just too many facts to remember them all.
          <br>Instead, you need to understand a few big ideas and know how to get the details you need when you need them</br></p>
            <h3>When you do forget stuff, there's lots of resources to help you out:</h3>

      <h2>Inline vs. Block Elements</h2>
        <p>In this video, Steve explains the distinction between inline and block elements.</p>

      <h2>Span and Div Elements</h2>
        <p>Span is an <em>inline</em> element.
        <br>Div is a <em>block</em> element.</br></p>

      <h2>HTML Document Structure</h2>
        <p>A part of writing good code is structuring it well.
        <br>In <b>HTML</b> particularly, the indentation level increases when an idea begins and decreases when an idea is finished.
        <br>The first line  should appear on every webpage you make. <b>DOCTYPE html</b> defines the type of the document so.
        <br>The <b>html</b> tag opens, our document. Everything that shows on the webpage is placed within this tag.
        <br>The <b>head</b> tag defines metadata for our web page. This includes the title of the page (this is what appears in the top of your tab or browser window).
        <br>The <b>title</b> tag is closed on the same line it was opened which we usually do if the content of a tag is short.
        The <b>head</b> tag is closed on a different line.
        <br>Notice that inside the <b>body</b> tags you have the content of the web page. 
        <br>You can see an <b>h</b> tag that is indented just inside the body as well as a <b>p</b> tag that is on the same level of indentation as the <b>h.</b></br></p>
